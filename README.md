# Rainy Day

#### Welcome to Rainy Day, and app that helps make your thumb a little greener! ðŸŒ±

One of the most important pieces of plant parenthood is getting your watering schedule just right. Too much water can kill a plant just as quickly as too little! Rainy Day will help to keep track of when you last watered your plants, and when you should next water them based on the schedule you choose.
